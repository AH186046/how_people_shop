# How People Shop
This repository is created for the concept of how people shop app for IKEA as an assignment for Tech Lead Assessment. 

The questions are answered in the following manner:

  **Question 1:** Sketch out an architecture diagram, showing the main components of the digital web-based HPS product. Indicate how the components
  communicate with each other and what architectural style are being used/followed?
  
  **Answer:** The file named "How People Shop Web App - Architecture Diagram" and uploaded as a PDF in the root of the project provides the answer. This diagram, presents a layered architecture for the web app and defines the components in each layer and how certain components communicate to each other, along-with decision, reasoning and description of layers. 
  
  **Question 2:** Design and diagram an underlying unified data model to be used to store and analyze and modify the primary data.
  
  **Answer:** The file named "HPS Data landscape and basic unified data model" and uploaded as a PDF in the root of the project provides the answer. This diagram, not only provides the unified data model but also explains questions in "The Data Landscape" page of the assignment. 
  
  **Question 3:** Define the relevant technical specifications and set of technologies that would be used to address the following operational aspects:
                  ❑ Extract data from different data sources, Transform it to the underlying data model, then Load it to the desired storage location.
                  ❑ Dealing with structured and unstructured data sources.
                  ❑ Scalability in order to process & serve behavioral data of billions of customers worldwide.
                  ❑ Support of various trigger mechanisms that would invoke data extraction and ingestion.
  
  **Answer:** The file named "Technical Specification and Set of Technologies for HPS" and uploaded as a PDF in the root of the project provides the answer as a diagram. All the operational aspects are covered in the diagram. 
  
  **Question 4:** Define what kind of technologies/platforms/tools should be used with or integrated into the application. Consider here also peripheral aspects such
  as observability and data quality.
  
  **Answer:** The answer to this question is provided in the same file as question 3, named "Technical Specification and Set of Technologies for HPS". 
  
  **Question 5:** List challenges/concerns that you see and indicate how you think they should be approached and resolved.
  
  **Answer:** The challenges/concerns and approach to resolve them are mentioned in the file "Challenges and Concerns" file and uploaded as a PDF in the root of this project.
  
  **Question 6:** Calculate the total number of cups of coffee that the HPS product team consumes each sprint. Explain how you arrived at your answer.
  
  **Answer:** The total number of cups of coffe that the team consumes each sprint is 140. The ideal team has following members:
          * Lead Engineer
          * Product Analyst
          * Data Engineer
          * Front end Engineer
          * Back end Engineer
          * DevOps Engineer
          * Technical Product Owner (Also acts as Scrum Master)
    So in total 7 team members and on average each team member consumes 2 cups of coffee and in a two week sprint which consists of 10 days, the team consumes 2 * 7 * 10 = 140 cups of coffee.
